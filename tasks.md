### Goals: ###
1. The game can be played by two to four playrs: (done)  

2. The dice outcome is realistic enough:  

3. A basic AI that plays with empirical strategies:  

4. Players can play with drag-and-drop control or touch control: (done)  


### Fixed: ###
1. In touch controls, when a seed goes outside, the 'selected' styling isn't removed  
2. In touch controls, when there are multiple seeds in a cell and one is selected then pushed behind (by double-clicking), it becomes impossible to select another seed  
3. When a seed can only play one (or some) of the dice outcomes, such as when it is close to 'home', the turns need to change after that seed exhausts all playable moves.  


### Issues to fix: ###
1. When a player gets a 6 6 they should, by choice, be able to roll the dice again before making the move.
2. Dropping on the home cell has issues when the mouse is specifically on the dice
